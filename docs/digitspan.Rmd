# Digit Span

The digit span test shows a series of sequences of digits of increasing length. The participant should look at the digits sequence and type it in when the last digit of the sequence disappear.

In this implementation, each digit is shown for T millisecond (T=1000 by default but can be changed). The first sequence shows K (K=3 by default but can be changed) digits. If the participants gets it right, the next sequence is of K+1 digits. If the participants gets it wrong, another sequence of length K is shown. The task ends and so the memory span is defined when the participant makes three consecutive errors for a given sequence length or when the span is 9 (this also can be changed easily).

The same task is duplicated asking the participant to type the digit sequence in reverse order.

In the data produced one finds the time needed to respond to each sequence (usually not important) and two variable, named `span` and `spanr` that contains the resulting memory span of the participant.

The test is implemented with a minimum of javascript code. It does not require any JS library and does not depend on the format of the survey it is included.
